1. fibo (none-optimize) => number return number in sequence in fibo Ex. 4 return 3
2. recursiveSummation => 10 return 10+9+8+7+6+...+1 = 55
3. isPalindrome => 'keyek' return true
4. findBinary => 6, '' return 110
5. binarySearch (recursive) => sorted list, firstIndex, lastIndex, item return indexOfItem
6. mergeSort => get unsorted list and return ascending list
7. Create a function which returns the number of true values there are in an array.
8. The right shift operation is similar to floor division by powers of two. Write a function that mimics (without the use of >>)
 the right shift operator and returns the result from the two given integers. ==> shiftToRight(80, 3) ➞ 10
9. Given three arguments — an object obj of the stolen items, the pets name and a value — return an object with that name and value in it (as key-value pairs). addName({}, "Brutus", 300) ➞ { Brutus: 300 }
10. Write a function that converts an object into an array, where each element represents a key-value pair in the form of an array. ==> toArray({ a: 1, b: 2 }) ➞ [["a", 1], ["b", 2]]
11. contain value in nestedObject
    const nestedObject = {
        data: {
            info: {
                stuff: {
                    thing: {
                        moreStuff: {
                            magicNumber: 44,
                            something: 'foo2'
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
12. totalIntegers in nestedObject
    [[[5], 3], 0, 2, ['foo'], [], [4, [5, 6]]] ==> 7
